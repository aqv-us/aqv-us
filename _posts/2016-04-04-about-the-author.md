Hi there! I'm AQV. Iâ€™m a physics major turned quant. Ever since I first learned how to program while taking a scientific computing for physics course, I have pursued quantitative modeling as a passion, and as a career. Check out [my website](https://www.aqv.us/) for more information on my other projects as well as some of my writing.
